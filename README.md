# Summerhouse reservation

Summerhouse reservation is an app for my family to make reservations of our summerhouse we share on the Swedish west coast. This is a first mvp (minimum viable product) which I belive will fullfill our basic need for making plans for our holidays in the summerhouse. But of course there are features to add in the future.
Because it will only be used by my family I don't want anyone to be able to register for an account by them self. My family will have to sign in to enter. Account must be set up by Admin. 
For this demo it is open for anonymous to view posts and there is also 4 accounts in place for testing.
Users: Sam (Admin), Lisa, Kalle, Anna
Password: SummerOf69

## Starting point

The id√© was to build a booking app for my familys summerhouse. We are always having trouble to handle the planing for the summer holidays. We have tried to schedule who and when with personal calendars or shared documents, with no success so I thought a web app could help. This is small and easy mvp, but hopefully it can grow. I started with three scetches. Both Calender view and Profile was added on the way as I was building and learning new things. 

### Scetches

# Validator Testing

### Accessibility
The Lighthouse test tool show good result in accesibility
